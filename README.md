## snake

Snake is my take on the classic Snake arcade game. 
You play as a snake (a moving line of squares), 
which you control with the arrow keys. The goal is to 
attempt to eat as many apples (green squares) as 
possible without running into yourself or the sides of 
the play arena.

An added mechanism to my version is the fact that the 
player is able to "constrict" an apple by surrounding it
with the snake, causing it to explode and give a point
bonus.

This game was hacked together in several hours over the 
period of a few days, so there may be some bugs. Also 
the code is terrible.
